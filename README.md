# kiji

This is a little single page app that enables you to create single articles 
(something like [pastebin.com](http://www.pastebin.com) with a little bit more style).
No registration is required and you can create totally anonymous articles if you want.

This site was actually online (http://kiji.io) for a couple of weeks but I decided to take it 
down for some reason (I have other plans for this domain).

I built this while I was learning [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) and the whole concept of single
page apps. It's not the greatest thing since sliced bread but I learned a lot.

Here are some screenshots:
